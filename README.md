<h1 align="center">🌐 Deploy SvelteKit to Netlify</h1>

## ❓ What is this?
This is an **experimental** command to run to add the netlify-adapter to your SvelteKit project.

## 🧰 Adding to SvelteKit
You must start with a fresh copy of the official SvelteKit template, which is currently created by running this command:
```sh
npm init svelte@next
```

Once that is set up, run this command in your project directory to set up the netlify-adapter:
```sh
npx svelte-add Leftium/netlify-adapter-adder
```

## 🛠 Usage
After the adder runs,
* You can deploy to Netlify.

* You can apply *another* [Svelte Adder](https://github.com/svelte-add/svelte-adders) to your project for more functionality.
